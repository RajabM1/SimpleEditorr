## Problem from SonarLint:-

### Bug: A bug in your code can cause unexpected behavior or incorrect results

* A "NullPointerException" could be thrown; "writer" is nullable here : major
Not handling a potential "NullPointerException" can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

* Use try-with-resources or close this "PrintWriter" in a "finally" clause : Blocker
Not closing a resource like a PrintWriter can cause resource leaks and potential memory issues. 

* Change this condition so that it does not always evaluate to "true" : major
A condition that always evaluates to "true" can lead to unintended behavior and bugs. 


### Code Smell: affect the maintainability and readability of your code in the long run.

* This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed : major  
Removing commented-out code can help keep the codebase clean and make it easier to maintain in the future.

* Add a nested comment explaining why this method is empty, throw an UnsupportedOperationException or complete the implementation : critical
Having empty methods without any comments can lead to confusion and make it difficult for other developers to understand what the method is supposed to do. 

* Make "matcher" transient or serializable : critical
Making "matcher" transient or serializable can help ensure that the object can be properly serialized and deserialized without any issues.

* "parent" is the name of a field in "Component" : Blocker
"parent" is a name that is already in use in "Component," it can lead to confusion and make the code harder to understand.

* Declare "close" on a separate line : MInor
Declaring variables on separate lines can help make the code easier to read and understand.

* Use static access with "javax.swing.WindowConstants" for "EXIT_ON_CLOSE" : critical
Using static access with "javax.swing.WindowConstants" for "EXIT_ON_CLOSE" can help improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase.

* Refactor this method to reduce its Cognitive Complexity from 45 to the 15 allowed : critical
Refactoring a method to reduce its cognitive complexity can make it easier to understand and maintain, as well as reducing the likelihood of bugs.

* Define a constant instead of duplicating any literal many times : critical
easier to change the value of the literal if necessary.

* Replace this use of System.out or System.err by a logger : major
Using System.out or System.err can make it difficult to debug code in production. 

* Define and throw a dedicated exception instead of using a generic one : major
Using a generic exception can make it difficult to identify and handle specific errors. 

* Extract this nested try block into a separate method : major
Nested try blocks can make code harder to read and understand. 

* Remove this unused private "saveAsText" method : major
Removing unused code can help keep the codebase clean and make it easier to maintain in the future.

* Make TP a static final constant or non-public and provide accessors if needed : MInor
Having a public mutable field can make it harder to maintain the codebase and lead to unexpected behavior.

* Rename this field "TP" to match the regular expression '^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$' : MInor
Having a field name that does not match naming conventions can make the code harder to read and understand. 

* Declare "paste" and all following declarations on a separate line : MInor
Declaring multiple variables on the same line can make the code harder to read and understand. 

* Remove this use of "CTRL_MASK"; it is deprecated : MInor
Using deprecated code can lead to potential compatibility issues and bugs.
